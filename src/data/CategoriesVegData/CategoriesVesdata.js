Be sure to squeeze as much water as possible so that the stuffing which we make is dry and will be easy to roll later. I love to have it with pickle or raita.

The dish is usually prepared for festivities and special occasions, when it is typically served alongside rice and breads such as roti.Although closely associated with North India, where it is a staple food, red kidney bean was actually brought to the country from central Mexico and Guatemala, but the Mexican version of the dish is much different than the Indian one. Hearty and nutritious, rajma remains one of the most loved vegetarian curries in Punjab and North India.",
