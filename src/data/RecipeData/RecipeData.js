      descriptiontitle: "ABOUT MOOLI PARATHA RECIPE",
      recipe: "Radish Paratha Recipe with Step by Step Pictures. Mooli Paratha is a soft paratha stuffed with spicy radish filling and cooked till golden. The first step in this is to toss the grated radish with some turmeric and salt..The reason we do this is to removes all pungent flavour from the radish. Be sure to squeeze as much water as possible so that the stuffing which we make is dry and will be easy to roll later. I love to have it with pickle or raita. You can even mix thick curd with pickle and have it with this. This is a great dish to put in lunch box. Since it is stuffed it stays soft for a long time. So I hope you love it and let me know what you think.",
